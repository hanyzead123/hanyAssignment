What does fork do?
fork creates a new process so we will have two processes: child and parent process. The child process gets
pid = 0 and the parent gets a positive number. In the program, each process prints a message to show who is
the parent and who is the child.

What is the job of the linker?
It links many compiled files into one program. We can make a function in one file and call it from another
file, then link them together. It also handles linking with libraries.

What is the job of the loader?
It prepares the program to run by putting the program into memory, loading the libraries it needs, and
starting the program. We can use 'ldd' to show the libraries used.

What happens when you change a file and recompile?
The output will change and the final program will be updated after using the linker with the new changes.
